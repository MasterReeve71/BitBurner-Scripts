First, use 'nano <name>.js' to create each of the scripts, using the name of each text file as <name> in the command.
Just copy/paste the text from each of the text files named for a script into the script of the matching name.

Then... simply type 'run start.js' on your in-game command line.

The scripts take care of:

1) hacking all the servers
2) buying additional servers to hack other servers
3) upgrading your purchased servers
4) buying/selling stocks (if you've already bought all the stock market stuff)
5) solving contracts (it doesn't do ALL of them, sadly... i haven't found code to solve them all)
6) buying and upgrading hacknet nodes

You still need to manually:

1) join factions
2) build rep with factions
3) buy augmentations from factions
4) install augmentations
5) buy all the stock market API stuff so auto-trade.js will work
6) advance through the game to get some parts of the scripts to function

Interestingly, this script seems to take more RAM to run on some 'home' servers than on others.
(If you're far enough into the game to understand that, you will. Otherwise, just take it as
a given and assume that you might not have enough RAM.)

If this is the case, you're going to have to manually copy the 'auto-hack.js' script to target
servers and trigger it, targetting the server it's on as all four of the script's arguments,
after you've gotten root access on the target server, of coruse.

Don't forget the 'analyze' the target server to find out how much RAM it has and run 'auto-hack.js'
using as many threads as possible!

You should also, of course, use your 'home' RAM to run 'auto-jack.js' using as many scripts as
possible, with all four of the easiest target servers (n00dles, foodnstuff, sigma-cosmetics, and
joesguns) for hacking, to help build your cash.

Save up money and upgrade your 'home' RAM until you can run the start script.
