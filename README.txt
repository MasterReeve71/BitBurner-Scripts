First, use 'nano <name>.js' to create each of the scripts, using the name of each text file as <name> in the command.

Any time you're starting over, such as after you've installed augmentations, do the following:

1) Start studying Computer Science at the university.
2) If you can already afford it, buy a TOR router.
3) Run 'start.js' at home.
4) Run 'nodebot.js' at home.

If you couldn't afford to buy one immediately, buy a TOR Router as soon as you can afford it! This will let you access the darkweb server. Any time you can afford to do so, you should buy a program from there, especially the five programs that open ports: BruteSSH.exe, FTPCrack.exe, relaySMTP.exe, HTTPWorm.exe, and SQLInject.exe. (In my experience, however, the 'Formulas.exe' program isn't very useful at all and can be skipped.)

Go ahead and run 'servers.js'. If you don't have enough money to make it happen, it'll tell you how much you need... then you just wait until you can afford it and re-run.

If your hack skill is high enough to let you, and it wouldn't be faster to just buy the program, don't be afraid to go to the 'Create Program' menu and write a program yourself -- especially if it's one of the ones that opens ports. The faster you can get your hands on those, the better! Personally, however, I prefer to just buy them and spend my 'working' time gaining reputation with a faction -- I rarely write my own programs.

As far as factions go, don't really bother joining any until you get a chance to join Sector-12. Work for them and build up reputation and save up cash to buy the Cashroot starter kit as soon as you are able to do so. This'll let you start with $1M and the BruteSSH.exe program.

Eventually, you'll also want to join the BitRunners faction and get the BitRunners Neurolink augmentation. This augmentation has you start with the FTPCrack.exe and relaySMTP.exe programs.

You can get whatever other augmentations you want, especially those that'll affect the speed, power, and ability of all your various hacking statistics.

Once you've cleaned a faction out of its augmentations, don't bother joining them again in future iterations (unless -everything- resets... which will, eventually, happen -- but I'm not going to give spoilers in this readme).

If you want to save up money from hacks without spending on hacknet nodes, just kill the process that's running 'nodebot.js' until you've done what you wanted/needed the money for, then restart it to keep growing your hacknet nodes.

There are servers (usually faction servers) that exist that have fair amounts of RAM, but zero max money. This makes them worthless for being hacking targets. However, you can copy 'autohacker.js' to them, figure out how many threads it can be run in on each of those servers, and then run the script on those servers with the script targeting other servers that *are* worth hacking. This can help you get more 'work' done on good targets.

Eventually (and likely after a few resets, with augmentations helping you get off to a quicker start in terms of earning money), you'll be able to afford to go to the Stock Market and buy a WSE Account, Trade Information eXchange (TIX) API Access, 4S Market Data TIX API Access, and 4S Market Data Access. It doesn't matter in what order you buy these, but once you have them all, run 'autotrader.js'. This script -will- fail if you don't own all the previously-listed items.
