First, use 'nano <name>.js' to create each of the scripts, using the name of each text file as <name> in the command.

If you have at least 128GB of RAM in your 'home' server, just type 'start' to kick things off!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you DO NOT have at least 128GB of RAM in your 'home' server, you need to rectify that situation in order to make full use of these scripts. To do this:


Any time you're starting over, such as after you've installed augmentations, do the following:
1) instead of starting by running start.js, start off by hacking easy servers
2) start hacking n00dles:
  a) copy auto-hack.js to n00dles
  b) connect to n00dles
  c) 'run nuke.exe'
  d) 'run auto-hack.js n00dles n00dles n00dles n00dles'
  e) 'home'
3) start hacking foodnstuff:
  a) copy auto-hack.js to foodnstuff
  b) connect to foodnstuff 
  c) 'run nuke.exe'
  d) 'run auto-hack.js foodnstuff foodnstuff foodnstuff foodnstuff'
  e) 'home'
5) start hacking sigma-cosmetics, joesguns, hong-fang-tea, harakiri-sushi, and nectar-net, also, once you meet their hacking skill requirements -- don't forget to put the name of the server itself in FOUR TIMES as the auto-hack.js script's arguments!
6) go into the city and start studying Computer Science at the university (the free study option) to build your hack skill more quickly -- this'll make the hacking on all these 'simple' servers go faster and earn you more money on the hacks
7) go into the city and to the 'alpha ent' tech store
8) as your money grows, select: Upgrade 'home' RAM until you've upgraded to at the needed 128GB of RAM on your 'home' server
9) restart and type 'run start.js' to kick it off properly

You should, of course, feel free to do more than the basics given in this outline if you know how and want to put in the extra effort to make things happen more quickly towards getting that 128GB of RAM.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

All the scripts are set up to kick off automatically when you do 'run start.js'. Yes, all of them. 

HOWEVER: If you haven't gotten all the stock market stuff (WSE Account, Trade Information eXchange TIX API Access, 4S Market Data TIX API Access, and 4S Market Data Access), one of the scripts (auto-trade.js) will NOT be kicked off -- because it requires those purchases in order to run. Once you have them, though, that script will eventually be automatically kicked off.

If you couldn't afford to buy one right away, buy a TOR Router as soon as you can afford it! This will let you access the darkweb server. Any time you can afford to do so, you should buy a program from the dark web, especially the five programs that open ports: BruteSSH.exe, FTPCrack.exe, relaySMTP.exe, HTTPWorm.exe, and SQLInject.exe. The other programs available there can be useful, also. (In my experience, however, the 'Formulas.exe' program isn't very useful at all and can be skipped.)

As far as factions go, don't really bother joining any until you get a chance to join Sector-12. Work for them and build up reputation and save up cash to buy the Cashroot starter kit as soon as you are able to do so. This'll let you start with $1M and the BruteSSH.exe program.

Eventually, you'll also want to join the BitRunners faction and get the BitRunners Neurolink augmentation. This augmentation has you start with the FTPCrack.exe and relaySMTP.exe programs.

You can get whatever other augmentations you want, especially those that'll affect the speed, power, and ability of all your various hacking statistics.

Once you've cleaned a faction out of its augmentations, don't bother joining them again in future iterations (unless -everything- resets... which will, eventually, happen -- but I'm not going to give spoilers in this readme).

NOTE: The 'solve-contracts.js' script is something I found online. I didn't build any of the algoritms and functions that are included in it, but it seems to work for a majority of contracts out there. I have noticed that there are some contract types that this script does NOT handle, such as "Total Ways to Sum II", "HammingCodes: Integer to encoded Binary", and "Shorted Path in a Grid". Solving contracts isn't that imporant in the grand scheme of the game, however, so this is all included in my script as an 'add-on'.
