First, use 'nano <name>.js' to create each of the scripts, using the name of each text file as <name> in the command.

Any time you're starting over, such as after you've installed augmentations, do the following:

Then, run 'start.js' (at home, of course).

Go into the city and study Computer Science at the university.

As soon as you can afford it, buy a TOR Router at any tech store in any city. This will let you access the darkweb server. Any time you can afford to do so, you should buy a program from there, especially the five programs that open ports: BruteSSH.exe, FTPCrack.exe, relaySMTP.exe, HTTPWorm.exe, and SQLInject.exe.

Go ahead and run 'deploy-servers.js'. If you don't have enough money to make it happen, it'll tell you how much you need... then you just wait until you can afford it and re-run.

AFTER you've run 'deploy-servers.js', you can run 'upgrade-servers.js'. If you can't afford the upgrade, it'll tell you how much you need to save up before trying again. Do this as often as you want -- the more upgraded your servers are, the more money they'll make you through hacking.

If your hack skill is high enough to let you, and it wouldn't be faster to just buy the program, don't be afraid to go to the 'Create Program' menu and write a program yourself -- especially if it's one of the ones that opens ports. The faster you can get your hands on those, the better!

As far as factions go, don't really bother joining any until you get a chance to join Sector-12. Work for them and build up reputation and save up cash to buy the Cashroot starter kit as soon as you are able to do so. This'll let you start with $1M and the BruteSSH.exe program. This is key to getting off to a quick start after future resets.

With that done, start focusing on getting all the augs for every possible faction, by joining that faction and working for them to improve reputation to the point that you can just save up money and buy stuff... then install/reset.

Once you've cleaned a faction out of its augmentations, don't bother joining them again in future iterations (unless -everything- resets... which will, eventually, happen -- but I'm not going to give spoilers in this readme).

I do have a 'nodebot.js' script to automatically buy/upgrade hacknet nodes and a 'nodebot-setup.js' script to set up a purchased server on which to do nothing but run 'nodebot.js'. I honestly don't use them myself, anymore. The process of continuously upgrading nodes slowed me down. I just use 'start.js' and nothing else, these days.

It -can- help kick things off a HUGE amount, if you can find and complete a money-rewarding contract or two, by letting quickly buy programs on the darkweb. Once you have all five of the port-opening programs, 'start.js' will eventually stop running, because its job will be completed.

Eventually (and likely after a few resets, with augmentations helping you get off to a quicker start in terms of earning money), you'll be able to afford to go to the Stock Market and buy a WSE Account, Trade Information eXchange (TIX) API Access, 4S Market Data TIX API Access, and 4S Market Data Access. It doesn't matter in what order you buy these, but once you have them all, run 'stockbot-setup.js' to automate your stock market trading. As before, if you can't afford to do the setup, it'll tell you how much you need to save up before trying again.
