First, use 'nano <name>.js' to create each of the scripts, using the name of each text file as <name> in the command.
Just copy/paste the text from each of the text files named for a script into the script of the matching name.

Then... simply type 'run start.js' on your in-game command line.

The scripts take care of:

1) hacking all the servers
2) buying additional servers to hack other servers
3) upgrading your purchased servers
4) buying/selling stocks (if you've already bought all the stock market stuff)
5) solving contracts (it doesn't do ALL of them, sadly... i haven't found code to solve them all)
6) buying and upgrading hacknet nodes

You still need to manually:

1) join factions
2) build rep with factions
3) buy augmentations from factions
4) install augmentations
