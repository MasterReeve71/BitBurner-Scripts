First, use 'nano <name>.js' to create each of the scripts, using the name of each text file as <name> in the command.

Any time you're starting over, such as after you've installed augmentations, do the following:

Then, run 'start.js' (at home, of course).

You should also run 'nodebot.js' (at home, of course). If you want to take some time to build up money and upgrading nodes is taking a lot out of your wallet, just go to srv-nodebot and killall. You can also go back to that server and restart it at a later time.

Go ahead and run 'deploy-servers.js' and 'nodebot-setup.js'. If you don't have enough money to make it happen for these, it'll tell you how much you need... then you just wait until you can afford it and re-run.

AFTER you've run 'deploy-servers.js', you can run 'upgrade-servers.js'. If you can't afford the upgrade, it'll tell you how much you need to save up before trying again. Do this as often as you want -- the more upgraded your servers are, the more money they'll make you through hacking.

If you don't have work to do (for a job or for a faction), study at the university to build your hack skill.

As soon as you can afford it, buy a TOR router. This will let you access the darkweb server. Any time you can afford to do so, you should buy a program from there, especially the five programs that open ports: BruteSSH.exe, FTPCrack.exe, relaySMTP.exe, HTTPWorm.exe, and SQLInject.exe.

If your hack skill is high enough to let you, and it wouldn't be faster to just buy the program, don't be afraid to go to the 'Create Program' menu and write a program yourself -- especially if it's one of the ones that opens ports. The faster you can get your hands on those, the better!

As far as factions go, don't really bother joining any until you get a chance to join Sector-12. Work for them and build up reputation and save up cash to buy the Cashroot starter kit as soon as you are able to do so. This'll let you start with $1M and the BruteSSH.exe program. This is key to getting off to a quick start after future resets.

Eventually (and likely after a few resets, with augmentations helping you get off to a quicker start in terms of earning money), you'll be able to afford to go to the Stock Market and buy a WSE Account, Trade Information eXchange (TIX) API Access, 4S Market Data TIX API Access, and 4S Market Data Access. It doesn't matter in what order you buy these, but once you have them all, run 'stockbot-setup.js' to automate your stock market trading. As before, if you can't afford to do the setup, it'll tell you how much you need to save up before trying again.

I'm definitely not a code-guru... so, though I've been using all my various scripts repeatedly and for a little bit of time, there may still be bugs in my code, for all that I know! :) My apologies if you encounter such, but if you do, and if you find a fix for them, by all means please let me know!
